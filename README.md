BACKSTORY

This project was inspired by the "Restaraunt Georgia" project in this <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/learn/lecture/17842006#overview" target="_blank">Vanilla JavaScript Course.</a> This is the first time I wrote JavaScript code as a major part of my project. As I made this project, I learned how to set alerts for limits on characters (ex. a 10 character minimum for a username, a 11 character limit for a password), as well as some light exposure to functions of JavaScript, such as the slice function.

PROJECT JOURNEY INSIGHTS

While doing this project, I saw how JavaScript and CSS work with each other. When I learned CSS, I wrote code to change button colors whenever said buttons are clicked, and when adding JavaScript code to the mix, it felt as if JavaScript built off of my knowledge of HTML and CSS: for instance, the form control "small" indicators I put in my CSS code was pinpointed when I wrote "small" for functions in JavaScript.

APP OVERVIEW

1. Username Form
   Simple box where a desired username is entered. Since only usernames between 4 and 16 characters are accepted, users will get an error message if they input a username less than 4 characters or more than 16 characters.

2. Email Form
   Simple box where an email linked to the username is entered. The JS function checkEmail(input) is inserted to confirm that the input is an actual email address.

3. Passwords Form
   A simple password form with verification of password by checking if the input for password is equal to the input of the confirm password box. Similarly to the username form, character limit (between 8 and 20 characters), error text will display if passwords do not meet the character limit or match.

4. Submit Button
   Click on the "Submit" button to see if the inputs for email, user name, and passwords are valid (matching passwords, valid email, username and password within character limits). Boxes will be highlighted in green if the inputs are valid.

TECHNOLOGIES USED
JavaScript
HTML
CSS

CHALLENGES
Time Management: Keeping app development within 1.5 hour scope - I spent 2 hours building this app.
Mispelling: Some JavaScript functions initially didn't do what was intended of them, and after looking at my code, I found that all of those errors were because I forgot a letter or added an extra period or marking that threw the code reader off.

FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Spelling: Be more careful about adding extraneous characters that will make the JavaScript code not work as intended
Refine Skills: Review HTML/CSS elements/functions
